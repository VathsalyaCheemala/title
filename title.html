<h1 align="center">Story of Jesus</h1> <hr><hr>
<h2>Jesus was born in Bethlehem to Mary, conceived miraculously by the Holy Spirit, and grew up in Nazareth.<br>At around 30, He began His ministry, teaching about love, forgiveness, and the Kingdom of God, while performing miracles like healing the sick and raising the dead. <p>His growing influence led to conflict with religious leaders, and He was betrayed, arrested, and crucified under Roman authority.</p> <p>Three days after His death, Jesus rose from the dead, appearing to His followers and proving His victory over sin and death.<br> He later ascended to heaven, promising to return, and His life and teachings continue to inspire billions as the foundation of Christianity.</p></h2> <hr><hr>
