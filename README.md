<h1 align="center">Story of Jesus</h1> <hr><hr>
<h2>Jesus was born in Bethlehem to Mary, conceived miraculously by the Holy Spirit, and grew up in Nazareth.<br>At around 30, He began His ministry, teaching about love, forgiveness, and the Kingdom of God, while performing miracles like healing the sick and raising the dead. <p>His growing influence led to conflict with religious leaders, and He was betrayed, arrested, and crucified under Roman authority.</p> <p>Three days after His death, Jesus rose from the dead, appearing to His followers and proving His victory over sin and death.<br> He later ascended to heaven, promising to return, and His life and teachings continue to inspire billions as the foundation of Christianity.</p>
<p> According to Christian tradition, as preserved in the Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles, Jesus was circumcised at eight days old, was baptized by John the Baptist as a young adult, and after 40 days and nights of fasting in the wilderness, began his own ministry. He was an itinerant teacher who interpreted the law of God with divine authority and was often referred to as "rabbi". Jesus often debated with his fellow Jews on how to best follow God, engaged in healings, taught in parables, and gathered followers, among whom twelve were appointed as his apostles. He was arrested in Jerusalem and tried by the Jewish authorities,[25] handed over to the Roman government, and crucified on the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect of Judaea. After his death, his followers became convinced that he rose from the dead, and following his ascension, the community they formed eventually became the early Christian Church that expanded as a worldwide movement.</p></h2> <hr><hr>
